%    This document is contained in a single file ONLY because
%    I wanted to be able to distribute it easily.  A real thesis ought
%    to be contained on many files (e.g., one for each chapter, at least).
%
%    To help you identify the files and sections in this large file
%    I use the string '==========' to identify new files.
%
%    To help you ignore the unusual things I do with this sample document
%    I try to use the notation

Overwhelming gratitude for Mary Lidstrom, who taught me biology, metabolic engineering, and supported my transition to computational biology and data science. 

David Beck, who mentored me throughout my PhD, encouraged me to complete the Advanced Data Science Option, and worked with me intensely in my last year. 

Many people who worked with me on wet-lab projects, most of which are not described in this document: Amanda Smith, Song Yang, Adam W, Justin Siegel,  

My committee: Francois, David Baker, and Barry Stoddard.
