I feel incredible gratitude for Mary Lidstrom, who taught me biology, metabolic engineering, and supported my transition to computational biology and data science.
It was clear that my and other lab members' best interests for scientific and professional development were always her top priority.
She will forever remain one of my top leadership role models.

I also  would like to thank David Beck for his computational mentorship over the years, especially the last few when we worked so closely.
His incredible knowledge breadth, and eagerness to share it with students is unparalleled.
It was Dave's enthusiasm for data science and support of knowledge-expanding coursework that led me to complete the Advanced Data Science Option.
I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to absorb so much data science knowledge before leaving the University of Washington.

Thanks to the dozens of people who helped me and collaborated with me on wet lab adventures, most of which are not described in this thesis.
I thank the Formolase project team, particularly Amanda Smith, David Baker, Adam W, Justin Siegel.
I thank the numerous Lidstrom Lab members; it was a pleasure to develop lab skills alongside you.
I thank Marina K. for initial mentorship in experimental biology, and Ludmila C. for years of consultation about methylotrophic metabolism.

I thank my family for guiding me toward engineering at a young age, and the support through these 25 years of education.

I also thank the community around the Data Science Studio and Advanced Data Science program at UW.
The impact of these programs on my training and career trajectory are substantial.

Finally, I thank my committee members for support throughout a very diverse PhD experience.
