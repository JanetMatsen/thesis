Engineered microbes will play a key role in the transition from fossil fuel derived chemicals to sustainable chemicals.
Successful production of such materials requires substantial deep understanding of microbial physiology, bioinformatics, and data science.
This thesis utilizes all three to study the metabolism of methane and methanol-utilizing microbes.
Both pure cultures and complex natural communities are studied.
The potential to leverage machine learning for large meta-omics data sets is also explored.
