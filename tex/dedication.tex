I dedicate this to my unbelievably cherished husband, Erick.
You inspired me to embark on this journey, helped keep the productivity tempo high, and contributed so greatly to my happiness.
I will fondly remember programming side by side at 5AM most mornings, regular discussions about computation and data science, and all the nerdy jokes we shared forever.
