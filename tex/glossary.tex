	Transcripts Per Kilobase Million, an alternative to RPKM.
	Reads per kilobase is calculated first, then these totals are normalized by dividing by the sum and 1,000,000. \\
	% Divide the read counts by the length of each gene in kilobases. This gives you reads per kilobase (RPK).
	% Count up all the RPK values in a sample and divide this number by 1,000,000. This is your ?per million? scaling factor.
