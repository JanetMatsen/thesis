\textbf{ANI} & Average nucleotide idenity, a measure of similarity between organisms. \\
\textbf{assembly} &  \\
\textbf{AWS} & Amazon Web Services, the leading cloud computing platform \\
\textbf{bin} &  \\
\textbf{binning} &  "clustering"? \\
\textbf{BWA} & Burrows-Wheeler Aligner, a tool for maping reads to reference DNA sequences \\
\textbf{CheckM} &  \\
\textbf{contig} & A contiguous DNA sequence.  In this case, they are the longer DNA stretches identified from assembling Illumina reads. \\
\textbf{C1} & Single-carbon compounds such as methanol, \ce{CO_2}, or formate \\
\textbf{coverage} & number of reads that include a given nucleotide in the reconstructed sequence \\
\textbf{d} &  \\
\textbf{EC2} &  \\
\textbf{EFS} &  \\
\textbf{Elviz} &  \\
\textbf{FASTA} &  TODO: note that blocks of sequence can be the DNA of a single contig, a single gene, or the nucleotide of a single gene.  \\
\textbf{feature} &  \\
\textbf{genomics} & the collective characterization and quantification of pools of DNA molecules \\
\textbf{genome bin} & a collection of contigs used to approximate a single organism's genome.  Often referred to as "bin". \\

\textbf{i.i.d.} & Independent and identically distributed.
    Each random variable has the same probability distribution as the others and all are mutually independent \\
\textbf{isolate} & \\
\textbf{JGI} & the Goint Genome Institute, U.S. Department of Energy laboratory who provided sequencing services for the metagenomics work of this thesis \\
\textbf{kb} & kilobase. A unit of DNA (or RNA) length, corresponding to 1000 base pairs. \\
\textbf{mapping} & Mapping of reads means XXX \\

\textbf{methanotroph} &  \\
\textbf{methylotroph} &  \\
\textbf{MyCC} &  \\
\textbf{N} &  \\
\textbf{N50} & the length for which the collection of all contigs of that length, or longer, contains at least half of the total of the
                lengths of the contigs in the assembly” \\ % https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4426941/pdf/bbi-9-2015-075.pdf (cites 49, 50)
\textbf{OB3b} & A RuMP cycle methanotroph, that is the subject of study in Chapter \ref{chapter:A}  \\
